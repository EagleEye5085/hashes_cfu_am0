# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? I actually got it pretty well. I would say I struggled the most with the if statement part.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? I know its not the best but i typically treat everything as open book because i always have google. I am in the process of getting a good journal to wright in though.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? I try my best first. I go over older lessons second. I ask some peers third. I use google last. In the Future I will probably use google before my peers to avoid annoying them.
